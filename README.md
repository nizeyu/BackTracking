# BackTracking
Final Project for CPE593(Author: Binglin Xie, Zeyu Ni, Yingbin Zheng)

Steps to run this program:
1.Please download the "Backtracking-FinalVersion" folder 
2.Please import “postgresql-9.4-1204.jdbc4.jar” as reference library.
3.Please change the database setting in “SQLHelper.java” in the package of “homework1.tools” if it is necessary.

Our project contains four packages and I described them as follows:
1. Package “test” contains “Test.java” for testing use. The “main()” is in the “test.java”  and the class is where the program begin with. In this class, it just call for other functions located in other packages to complete the program. 
2. Package “control” contains “Query1.java” and “Query2.java”， which are the main sections in my program. They contain all algorithms to figure out the queries and the output functions for the reports.

Project Description:
We develop highly efficient solutions based on backtracking for Magic Squares, n-queens, and sudoku. We focus on improving the efficiency of Algorithm by skipping illeagal solutions. Testing and evaluation can be conducted to evaluate the performance of backtracking Algorithm. 

The responsibility distribution:
Binglin Xie will be responsible for n-queens solution design; 
Zeyu Ni will be in charge of Magic Squares solution design；
Yingbin Zheng will take sudoku algorithm implementation.
Together: We are all engaged in the recommender system development including user story writing and prototyping design, website layout and function implementation, etc.
