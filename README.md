# BackTracking
Final Project for CPE593(Author: Binglin Xie, Zeyu Ni, Yingbin Zheng)

Project Description:
We develop highly efficient solutions based on backtracking for Magic Squares, n-queens, and sudoku. We focus on improving the efficiency of Algorithm by skipping illeagal solutions. Testing and evaluation can be conducted to evaluate the performance of backtracking Algorithm. 


-What resources we need that you don’t already have?
In this project, we need a lot of course and student information which we do not already have. We can obtain the information from official website or experience from senior students.

The responsibility distribution:
Binglin Xie will be responsible for n-queens solution design; 
Zeyu Ni will be in charge of Magic Squares solution design；
Yingbin Zheng will take sudoku algorithm implementation.
Together: We are all engaged in the recommender system development including user story writing and prototyping design, website layout and function implementation, etc.
